# public_projects
Here you will find personal data analytics projects that highlight some of my skills and interests.
All projects based on jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) files have corresponding .html or .pdf files for readability. Please check out the .html and .pdf files first!
None of these projects should be considered complete: I may come back and add more to a project if I have time.
I find that as I answer analysis questions, it leads to even more questions and the digging can go on forever.

I hope you enjoy what you see. Please message me on [Linkdin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmund-dale-aa0b19168/) if you would like to get in touch with me, or if you have questions or critiques about my analyses. I love constructive criticism because it's a great tool for growth.

Thank you for your interest!
